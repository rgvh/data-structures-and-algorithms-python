# Challenge 01 - Reverse an Array

## Challenge
Given an array (list) as an argument, return a list with the elements in reversed order without using any built-in methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
Use a for loop to append the element from the original list to a new list starting from the end of the original list.

Efficiency: O(N) - Since a loop is used, the efficieny of the function follows a linear path as inputs increase.
